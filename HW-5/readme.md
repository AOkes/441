#441 HW-5
In this assignment, I felt I was getting through it very well. I enjoyed using
arrays when I worked with coding in the past, so I felt it would be fun and easy
to use them again. I did run into a few debugging issues when I was making this
page however. The main one that I got caught on regarded the while loop I used,
which wouldn't stop running, and I couldn't find out why. After awhile, I found I
made a syntax error when creating my count array, which I managed to find when I
noticed that when I reduced my while loop count to lower numbers, it would run, however
it wouldn't produce all of my images, only the first few. After fixing that problem,
the rest of the assignment went over much more smoothly.
