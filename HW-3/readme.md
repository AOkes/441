#441 HW-3
In this assignment, the main challenges I encountered where trying to figure out how to
get the JavaScript to work in the way I intended for it.  One particular challenge that
I encountered was trying to get the DOM to display properly. When I initially created the code,
I was running into an issue where my DOM would vanish after pressing the button to start the
adventure.  I found that because I had written in "The End" in a document.write command, it
was somehow causing the DOM to vanish after pressing the button, so simply removing it fixed the
issue, and I was able to complete the assignment with much more ease.
