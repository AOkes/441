For this assignment, I ran into a few difficulties with getting the coding to work. I chose to use
the Pokemon types example JSON, and ended up making my webpage on a sample of the Pokemon abilities
found on there. I had a difficult time getting the entire JSON to work properly as there were
many different parts to it and it seemed like no matter how much code I wrote, I just couldn't
get all of the information to display. Thus, I cut down on the JSON and made it so it would
display the name of the ability as well as the url for that particular ability. Overall I do
feel like I came away with some better knowledge about the JSON part of scripting and how to
implement it properly.
