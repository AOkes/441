#441 HW-2 Readme
This assignment was pretty straight forward for me, I felt like I was able to understand the console
fairly easily.  I am pretty familiar with JavaScript so I look forward to doing more with the
different stuff that the program can do.  I had a little bit of fun with what I had displayed
on the webpage.  The only process that took a little bit of extra time was the style element in
the heading because I am not that used to putting that element in on the actual HTML, and instead
I am more used to putting it in on the CSS page.
