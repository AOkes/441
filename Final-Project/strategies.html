          In this video clip from YouTube, you can see just how good the competitive scene is at Tetris, and just how in depth the game is for having such a
          simple concept. The Tetris pieces fall to the stage faster and faster, and the players have to match that speed in order to succeed. Not only that,
          but the players have to also think of their block placements at the same time, giving Tetris a huge learning curve when entering into the higher
          levels. One key strategy that these players use is to keep a level playing field. If you watch the above video, you can see that both players will build
          to one side of the playing field, trying to keep it as level as possible with no gaps, while leaving a 1 square gap on the other side. This allows them
          to fit all of the pieces onto one side, and when they get the long awaited Line Piece, then they use it to fill the gap they left, clearing a large chunk
          of the board much easier than they would trying to utilize the other pieces. Take a look at some of the other games of Tetris below.
