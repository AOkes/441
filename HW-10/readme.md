#441 HW-10
For this assignment, I didn't have a ton of difficulty, however it did take a
decent chunk of time to type out all of the code. The main problems I ran into
were trying to get the screen color to revert back to it's original color.
However, I realized how I could easily just use the same code I had before to
change it back with an else statement added on to the if statement.  Another issue
I ran into was making the game end. I didn't have this quite in mind, and so when I
first tried it, the bouncing square, or ship, went to it's default size and never was
responding to the collision again, so I ended up having to make a game end when the player
reached a certain size.
