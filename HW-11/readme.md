For this assignment, it took some time to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. After some thinking, I finally decided
to create a sort of maze, since one of the assignment requirements was to make the initial objects unable to
go through each other. I felt like I had some fun with this assignment, the only issues I ran into was trying to
get the points to work properly, as well as add to the scoreboard. after some doing, I managed to get it to
delete the points after I collected them, making it less about just getting to the nearest point and sitting
on it.
