      <h1>A Brief History of Tetris</h1>

          Tetris has a pretty long history in terms of gaming, and has been a classic game since as early as the 1980's. In 1984, the game was created
          by Alexey Pajitnov, a Russian software engineer in Soviet Russia. Licensing for the game was surprisingly erratic, bouncing between several companies
          including Nintendo until eventually coming back to Pajitnov in 1996. Since the game's creation, it has sold (as a series) 202 million copies as of
          December 2011. Many people, including myself, still to this day think of Tetris as an exclusively Nintendo property, however, upon further research,
          Nintendo and Pajitnov fought for the rights of the game for several years. The game was actually originally created for a machine dubbed 'Electronika 60'.
          Pajitnov originally created the game while he was trying to recreate a puzzle game from his childhood, using pentominoes. However, he reimagined the
          game, and renamed the pieces 'tetriminos', and titling the game 'Tetris', a combination of the word tetromino and tennis, his favorite sport. Since its
          creation in the 1980's, Tetris has been released for over 65 different platforms, giving it a Guiness World Record for the most ported video game title.
