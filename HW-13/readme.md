# 441 HW-13
For this assignment I played around with the three.js for quite a while. I found
that it is really versatile, and I only really messed with the different shapes
and tried out using a few 3D models I created. One issue I had difficulty solving
was making sure the color shows. In the 3D object creator app I used, whenever I
painted an object to be a different color than it was by default, the object would
show up as black. Since I didn't realize it until later, I spent a lot of time trying
to fix the light when that wasn't the problem. I never managed to fix it, so instead
I left the colors to their default settings. Aside from that, this assignment went fairly
smoothly I feel like.
