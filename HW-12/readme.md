# 441 HW-12
I had a lot of fun with this assignment. It felt really rewarding using Phaser as I
felt that it made things a lot less tedious to make. I didn't run into very many issues
over the course of this assignment, which to me means that Phaser is very intuitive
to use, once you get used to it. Making the level function took some doing, but
wasn't very difficult. I did have some issues with the sprite implementation, but
only due to my own faults as I was counting the frames incorrectly, not starting from
0, and instead starting from 1.
