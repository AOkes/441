#441 HW-6
For this second part of the memory matching assignment, I was able to get through it fairly well.
I didn't run into too many bugs, apart from one that took some working with to
get working in the system. The bug I ran into was causing my name to not appear in
the final screen, and I finally got it working once I had realized that I had forgotten
to add my player info to the body load on my memory matching page itself, so once I had
done that, everything else ran smoothly. One thing I wanted to change but couldn't quite
figure out how to implement was making the user not able to click on any more pictures
until the initial two that they had clicked on disappeared, however I couldn't get it to work,
so I ended up just going with what I had that worked.
