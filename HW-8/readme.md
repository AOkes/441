For this assignment, it took me some time to get used to using the jQuery. Although
I understood how it worked, it took some time for me to get it properly running, as
I was having some difficulty getting the code to work the way I intended it to work.
Once I did however, I felt really pleased with what I could do with it. Things that would
have normally taken me many hours to get working took a much shorter amount of time when
I was using jQuery. I decided to use the opportunity to make an homage to my dog,
Templeton, who passed away last summer, and I felt I was able to do him justice using the
tools provided by jQuery
