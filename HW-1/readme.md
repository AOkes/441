#441 HW-1 Readme
This assignment took some time for me. I went through some of my previous classes on web design so that I could create a aesthetically pleasing site that I would be happy with.  Overall I think it turned out well, although it took some bug fixing to get the webpage to display properly in the way I wanted it to show up.  It also took me some time to get used to using the css code again as I haven't been practicing very much since my last class on Web Design.  Some things that I was happy to get working included the parallax effect, which took some doing but I managed to get it working.  However, I ran into difficulties with creating my final section in a pleasing way, and finally weeded through the example page to see what I could do to fix it, and finally got it into the design I felt was best. One part I couldn't figure out how to fix was the middle section ending up too close to the bottom section.
