          On this webpage, you will learn about the wonderfully simple game of Tetris, that has been around since the 1980's, and is one of the best selling games
          of all time, selling 35,000,000 copies on the Game Boy alone. Many of you will have probably already heard of Tetris, and probably a large amount of
          you will have also played the game. It's a very simple concept, stacking pieces of various shapes onto a board with the only controls being rotating the
          pieces, dropping the pieces faster, and in certain iterations, storing a piece for later use. You also must try not to leave any gaps in your
          stacking. When you fill a horizontal layer, you earn a TETRIS, clearing the pieces on the horizontal row and gaining points. If you hit the top of the
          screen, the game is over. A extremely simple to understand concept, but a very difficult game to master, especially with the later levels causing the
          pieces to fall faster and faster.
