#441 HW-4
In this assignment, I had some difficulties, as there was a decent amount of JavaScript
and plenty of places for errors to come up. I managed to get through a sizeable amount without
issue, however I ran into problems with the for loop I wanted to implement. I spent
several minutes of my time on this assignment trying to get one to work, but When
I implemented it, the loop would break my page. Finally I found where I made a mistake,
which was a simple error, and managed to correct it. Overall, I was happy with the result of
this assignment.
